Description
-----------
The AttributeConfigurator enables you to centralize the versioning of your attributes in one file (compared to have
them scaattered over several update scripts).

Configuration is found at System/Configuration/Catalog/Catalog/Attribute Configurator.

Import Path is created at Magento Base Director with var/importexport/product_attributes. Change this path in
the config if this doesnÂ´t suit your needs - but use only var as it is some kind of spool file.

Requirements
------------
- PHP >= 5.2.0
- Mage_Core

Compatibility
-------------
- Magento >= 1.7

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Use the included modman manifest to integrate into your project. If you want to manually copy the files, use the directory structure provided at /src.

Uninstallation
--------------
1. Remove all extension files from your Magento installation

Planned Features
----------------
- supply an XML File with attribute information (name, label, type, values/options, ...)
- add new attributes
- change existing one (type change also, but in some cases information loss is inevitable)
- clean up no longer needed ones
- just care about a specific subset that comes/came from XML (handled by flagging) to not interfere with system or 3rd party attributes
